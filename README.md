Tanks! - 2659 Course Project

Edison Mendoza & Paul Staples

3/5/2016  - Removed all files, replaced with copies organized into folders, added Stage 4 folder.
          
          - Placed all active structs into a super struct call "model". Makes everything easier to access and many less parameters
            are required in functions.
